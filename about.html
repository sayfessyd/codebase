<p>I am <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}">@sayfessyd</a> an independent software engineer. Outside of developing software, I enjoy playing piano.</p>
<p>I have worked on several projects since June 2014 as a self-employed full stack developer trying to enhance my own skills and discover many technologies, especially the web's ecosystem which still growing day by day until now. I am the author of an image editor called Lollipop that has reached almost 200 sales on CodeCanyon as a 5-star product, and also open source projects on <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}">Github</a>.</p>
<p>I have always been interested in creating beautiful products that can have great impacts. I created my first baby (i.e., product) in 2015, it was a challenge that motivates me as a student of computer science to create a software product that can compete with other products founded by software development companies. I have much learned from this experience since I solved many technical problems and discovered many technologies during the development process.</p>
